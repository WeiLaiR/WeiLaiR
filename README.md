* A college student about to graduate.
* Java and Go are very good programming languages(Java is always the best).
* This is my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/u/weilai-/) homepage.
* This is my [blog](https://baiblog.top), which is not updated frequently, so there is not much content.
  * (I usually write a lot of notes, but occasionally I post them on my blog on a whim)
